ReactJs : A javaScript library for creating user interfaces, makes the development of UI easy and modular.

Features of React:-
1. Component Based Architecture
2. Virtual Dom
3. Unidirectional Data Flow
4. JSX Syntex (i.e similar to XML and HTML)
5. SEO Performance is increased using React

React:-
React is a small view library
React covers only the rendering and event handling part
Presentation code in JavaScript powered by JSX
React's core size is smaller than Angular, so bit fast
React is very flexible	Angular has less flexibility
Great performer, since it uses Virtual DOM

Angular:-
Angular is a full framework 
Angular provides the complete solution for front-end development
Presentation code in HTML embedded with JavaScript expressions
Angular being a framework contains a lot of code, resulting in longer load time
React is very flexible	Angular has less flexibility
Angular uses actual DOM which affects its performance

Software Requirement:
1. Node.js (version 14+)
2. A Code Editor(Visual Studio Code)
3. 


Installation:-
